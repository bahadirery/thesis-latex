abstract = {Recent years have seen an increase in alarming signals regarding the lack of replicability in neuroscience, psychology, and other related fields. To avoid a widespread crisis in neuroimaging research and consequent loss of credibility in the public eye, we need to improve how we do science. This article aims to be a practical guide for researchers at any stage of their careers that will help them make their research more reproducible and transparent while minimizing the additional effort that this might require. The guide covers three major topics in open science (data, code, and publications) and offers practical advice as well as highlighting advantages of adopting more open research practices that go beyond improved transparency and reproducibility.},

abstract = {Concrete surface crack detection is an important means to ensure infrastructure security, including bridges and tunnels. In recent years, computer vision has been widely adopted for concrete surface crack detection, and the intelligent crack detection method based on computer vision has achieved good results with the breakthrough of the deep learning algorithm. However, there are also some challenges, such as complex architecture, high computing burden, and time-consuming training. In this paper, a lightweight broad learning system detection method called MobileNetV3-BLS is proposed. First, the inverted residual structure with the linear bottleneck of MobileNetV3 is introduced as the convolution module of the proposed broad learning system for feature extraction. Then the extracted features are employed to randomly generate both mapping and enhancement nodes in a broad learning system, which are used to train the crack detection model. The proposed MobileNetV3-BLS can improve crack detection accuracy and training speed compared with other classical deep learning networks. On the other hand, the proposed method is a dynamic network of which the weights can be updated quickly to achieve incremental learning by adding new nodes and samples.}

Yet, compared to more established disciplines, a lack of common experimental standards remains an open challenge to the field at large. Starting from fundamental scientific principles, we distill ongoing discussions on experimental standards in NLP into a single, widely-applicable methodology. Following these best practices is crucial to strengthen experimental evidence, improve reproducibility and enable scientific progress. These standards are further collected in a public repository to help them transparently adapt to future needs.",

Secondly, it describes the structural principle, the characteristics, and some kinds of classic models of deep learning, such as stacked auto encoder, deep belief network, deep Boltzmann machine, and convolutional neural network. Thirdly, it presents the latest developments and applications of deep learning in many fields such as speech processing, computer vision, natural language processing, and medical applications. Finally, it puts forward the problems and the future research directions of deep learning.}
